# Exercise I:

a) 0(n) as it will scale up proportionately with n value

b) Quadratric with 4 for loops so 0(n^c) which in this case is 0(n^3)

c) 0(1) as the amount of operations doesn't change

# Exercise II:

Treat it like a binary tree and start at f/2. If it breaks, go down to f/4 and try. If it doesn't break, go to f(3/4) and continue narrowing the possibilities until an answer is found.
